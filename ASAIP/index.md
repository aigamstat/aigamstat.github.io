# ASAIP

The **Astro-Statistics and Astro-Informatics Portal (ASAIP)** was originally hosted at [asaip.psu.edu](https://asaip.psu.edu/) by the Pennsylvania State University Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and co-edited by Eric Feigelson and the late Joseph Hilbe. Both of their sustained efforts and excellent leadership helped to establish the ASAIP as a coordinated website for the major astrostatistical organizations worldwide, including this one. Presently, the ASAIP is being hosted and maintained by the ASA/AIG at this website.
