# Astrostatistics sessions at JSM

**Note: all times are in PDT, Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)**

We will use an [Astrostatistics Interest Group Slack channel](https://astrostatisti-dzq6013.slack.com/archives/C011GJMLLET) to ease communication between the audience and the speakers at the various sessions. In order to be added to this channel, please contact one of the office bearers or write to [aigamstat @ gmail.](mailto:aigamstat@gmail.com?Subject=Slack)

## JSM Astrostatistics Slack Channel

To see news and announcements regarding JSM and the astrostatistics sessions, or to simply ask questions, go to [this Slack workspace](https://astrostatisti-dzq6013.slack.com/x-p1071525927828-1068608198114-2351887732176/) and go to the #jsm2022 channel.
