<p style="text-align: center;"> CHARTER FOR THE ASTROSTATISTICS INTEREST GROUP </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> ARTICLE I. NAME </p>


The name of this organization is the Astrostatistics Interest Group of the American Statistical Association, herein after referred to as the Interest Group.


<p style="text-align: center;"> ARTICLE II. SCOPE</p>


The objective of the Interest Group is to:

1. Expose statisticians to astronomy as a fruitful area of collaborative methodological development and educate them as to the abundant, diverse, and challenging quantitative problems faced by astronomers â€” from the small-scale particle nature of dark matter to the large-scale structure of the Universe, and everything in between.

2. Advertise and promote conferences, workshops, summer schools, and events at the intersection of astronomy, astro-particle physics, astrophysics, computer science, cosmology, solar physics, and statistics.

3. Establish and maintain connections with related working groups in astronomy in the U.S. and internationally, such as with the International Astrostatistics Association (IAA), and including an affiliation with the Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal (ASAIP).


<p style="text-align: center;"> ARTICLE III. MEMBERSHIP </p>


Membership in the Interest Group is open to anyone interested in Astrostatistics. There are no dues.


<p style="text-align: center;"> ARTICLE IV. MEETINGS </p>


The annual business meeting of the Interest Group shall be held in connection with the annual Joint Statistical Meetings and shall be announced in advance, preferably in the program for that meeting. Business may also be conducted with the Interest Group members by mail and/or email.
