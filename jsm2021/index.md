# Astrostatistics sessions at JSM

#### INDEX | [AIG meeting](#aig-annual-meeting) | [Student Paper Award](#sessionid-tbd) | [Statistical Challenges in Cosmology](#session-220603) | Other sessions

We will use an [Astrostatistics Interest Group Slack channel](https://astrostatisti-dzq6013.slack.com/archives/C011GJMLLET) to ease communication between the audience and the speakers at the various sessions.  In order to be added to this channel, please contact one of the office bearers or write to [aigamstat @ gmail.](mailto:aigamstat@gmail.com?Subject=Slack)

# Session 220603
### Date TBD
## [Statistical Challenges in Cosmology](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=220603)

  The era of precision cosmology has brought many statistical challenges to the fore of the field. In this session a mixed group of astronomer/statistician speakers will discuss a variety of modern "cosmostatistical" problems.
